\section{Introduction}
Mobile computing is winning over more users with every day. Nowadays
virtually everybody owns a smartphone or at least a similar mobile device. Some
people even use more than one mobile device in their everyday life. This
``addiction" makes people rely more and more on their daily mobile helpers.
They get very busy during the day, which makes it easy to forget even simple
tasks such as buying milk. The problem is that when the user does remember
accomplishing something, he is prevented due to various factors like location
differences.
\newline
\newline
Our goal is to provide a solution for a simple to-do list combined with a
location aware service, which would remind the user of a planned activity when
he or she gets near the provided geo point.
