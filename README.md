Location-Reminder is an application where the user can store tasks.
It is like a To-Do list, but the items are linked to a specific location. The user can choose on a map interface(e.g. Googlemaps) on which location the item is linked. Is the user in an specific radius near to this location the application notices this and reminds the user that in this area there is an item on the list, that could be executed. The user is also able to define the specific radius in which the application reminds him. The type how the user is being reminded is also definable, it is possible to choose between an alarm sound or a vibration notification. It is also possible to set a range of time where the application reminds the user, for example the app just reminds the user to buy some milk between Monday and Friday in a specific time. All To-Do items are fully edit- and deletable. Additional information about a To-Do item can be stored in the application, too.
